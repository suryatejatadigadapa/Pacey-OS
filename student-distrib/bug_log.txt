Checkpoint 1

	Date: 03/11/2016
	Problem: IDT entries not initialised properly.Caused Triple Fault and General Protection Fault.
	Solution: Assembly linker was not liking functions properly. Fixed the calls by extern-ing and making functions global where required.Also some idt entries DPL were incorrect.
	Time to fix: 1 Day

	Date: 03/12/2016
	Problem: Received only one keyboard interrupt
	Solution: Sent the eoi signal.
	Time to fix: 2 Hours

	Date: 03/13/2016
	Problem: Paging didn’t work.
	Solution: Changed structure of paging from a union of structs to an array and set the correct bits.
	Time to fix: 6 Hours

Checkpoint 2

	Date: 03/22/2016
	Problem: Read Data reading wrong values.
	Solution: Fix typecasting to add 1 or 4 or 1024 or 4096 based on values being accessed.
	Time to fix: 1 Day

	Date: 03/23/2016
	Problem: Read data function was over 400 lines because of masking a 32 byte pointer to get 8 bytes at a time. Using a 8 bytes pointer caused page faults or blank screens.
	Solution: Expanded the function to first work with very inefficient code (over 400 lines), then condensed it to 40 odd lines by accessing data 8 bytes at a time properly.
	Time to fix: 3 Days

	Date: 03/25/2016
	Problem: FS dir functions gave erroneous output a lot of times
	Solution: Missed edge cases in read dentry by name and read dentry by index. Fixed them by doing param checks and invalid value checks.
	Time to fix: 4 Hours

	Date: 03/27/2016
	Problem: Scrolling broke in random cases.
	Solution: Added calls to scroll in multiple places.
	Time to fix: 1 Hour

	Date: 03/27/2016
	Problem:Keyboard buffer overflow
	Solution:Checked buffer overflow
	Time to fix: 1 Hour

Checkpoint 3

	Date: 04/07/2016
	Problem: Shell not running in spite of loading the correct eip
	Solution: Restored stack properly after execute call, added 16 to esp. Correct values for context switching.
	Time to fix: 10  Hours

	Date:  04/08/2016
	Problem: Did not return to shell after halt
	Solution: Mapped to the correct physical memory (of parent) in halt.
	Time to fix: 7 Hours

	Date:  04/08/2016
	Problem: Not loading the entire program.
	Solution: Calculated file length correctly.
	Time to fix: 4 Hours

	Date: 04/11/2016
	Problem: The exit command was not recognized.
	Solution: terminal buffer had an extra ‘\n’, removed that.
	Time to fix: 4 Hours

	Date: 04/12/2016
	Problem: Halt would page fault.
	Solution: Flushing the TLB.
	Time to fix: 4 Hours

Checkpoint 4

	Date: 04/16/2016
	Problem: Fish wouldn’t work because read data was returning -1 for a wrong err check condition.
	Solution: Fixed it by changing the err check condition.
	Time to fix: 2 hours

	Date: 04/16/2016
	Problem: Failed err_syscall_num test in Sys_Err.
	Solution:  Assembly linkage for system calls did not check for out of range values.Also the file functions.
	Time to fix: 1 Hour

	Date: 04/16/2016
	Problem: Pingpong printed only the first two lines.
	Solution: Initialized rtc in kernel.c
	Time to fix: 1 Hour

	Date: 04/18/2016
	Problem: Only 3 shells worked.(Storing the pcb structure in memory that wasnt mapped)
	Solution: Subtracted multiples of 24 kb from base kernel stack rather than adding it.
	Time to fix: 2 Hours

	Date: 04/19/2016
	Problem: Cat RTC didn’t work.
	Solution: Added a variable tick to flag that RTC read was writing a value. 
	Time to fix: 2 Hours

Checkpoint 5

	Date: 04/28/2016
	Problem: TSS loaded wrong esp/ebp values when context switching, causing page faults.
	Solution: Corrected the process ids in the context switch
	Time to fix: 3 Days

	Date: 04/29/2016
	Problem: Page fault when halting a process after running scheduling.
	Solution:  Context switching wrong err condition
	Time to fix: 1 Day

	Date: 04/29/2016
	Problem: Cursor showed up at the wrong location when switching terminals.
	Solution: Saved cursor positions for every terminal
	Time to fix: 2 Hours

	Date: 04/30/2016
	Problem:Files closed incorrectly
	Solution: Each PCB did not have its own file descriptor array
	Time to fix: 2 Hours

	Date: 04/30/2016
	Problem: Squash not implemented
